# Frontend Design Pro

One-command composition layer for premium frontend output.

## Execution Order (Strict)
1. Apply `design-taste-frontend` first.
   - Enforce anti-slop constraints, architecture discipline, motion/perf guardrails, and QA gates.
2. Run `frontend-design-ultimate` second.
   - Execute the full generation workflow (aesthetic direction, scaffolding/build path, responsive implementation).

Never invert this order.

## Quick Usage Prompts
- "Use frontend-design-pro to build a SaaS landing page with strict anti-slop guardrails and a complete production-ready React/Tailwind implementation."
- "Use frontend-design-pro to redesign this dashboard: enforce taste guardrails first, then generate a bold but maintainable frontend."
- "Apply frontend-design-pro for a mobile-first marketing site with strong typography, disciplined motion, and clean deployment-ready output."

## When To Use
- You want one-command UX that combines strict design guardrails plus end-to-end frontend generation.
- You need high-quality React/Next.js/Vite UI output with explicit anti-generic constraints.
- You want consistent production discipline across layout, motion, responsiveness, and implementation.

## When Not To Use
- You only need guardrails/compliance checks without full generation (use `design-taste-frontend` directly).
- You only need scaffolding/generation workflow without strict taste enforcement (use `frontend-design-ultimate` directly).
- You are not doing frontend/UI work.
